# x86DE

x86 Decoder and Encoder
This project currently does not support encoding (assembling) at the moment. 
After many failed attempts, I've successfully put together an (mostly-complete) x86 Disassembler.
The include folder contains websites used as references when putting together this project.

The following references were used:
